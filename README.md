# Mido Extension Classes

These classes extend the [Mido](https://github.com/mido/mido) python library for midi.

The main purpose of these classes is to convert midi notes from the standard encoding of "note on" and "note off" messages into one midi note with a "length" attribute (and back).

#### Requirements
* mido (pip install mido)
* copy (pip install copy)
